## Anthropogenic effects on chungungo's abundance

Here we will explore some anthropogenic variables as potential drivers os abundance change on this species

```{r data}
#loading libraries
library(mgcv)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(pbkrtest)
library(MuMIn)
library(MCMCglmm)
library(ggplot2)

#loading data
data<-read.table("data/data.txt", header = T)
attach(data)
```

Let's do some nice ggplots to examine our data before fitting fancy models:



## Models

To do this, we will use a Poisson GLMM, using site and sampling month as random factors.

```{r model1}
mod1<-glmer(abund~people+boats+pets+algae+(1|site)+(1|month), family = "poisson", na.action = "na.fail")
summary(mod1)
```

Well, it seems that none of our predictor variables are significant... Also, R warns us that we have _singular fit_ (this [article](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#singular-models-random-effect-variances-estimated-as-zero-or-correlations-estimated-as---1) to solve that)

Let's try some multi-model inference to examine the relative support of each variable to our dataset

```{r mumin1}
mm1<-dredge(mod1, rank = BIC)
subset(mm1, delta <5)
get.models(mm1, subset = delta < 2)
imp.mm1<-importance(mm1)
barplot(t(imp.mm1), main="Predictors", col="black", xlab="Variable", ylab="Relative support")
```

Well, it seems that all predictor variables have similar importance.

Following Ben Bolker's advice, we can avoid singular fit by removing those random effects with a very litle contribution (in this case, _month_). Let's try fitting a new model using only _site_ as random effect:

```{r model2}
mod2<-glmer(abund~people+boats+pets+algae+(1|site), family = "poisson", na.action = "na.fail")
summary(mod2)
```

Well, there is no singular fit now, BUT none of our predictor variables is significant (doh!)

Let's examine multi-model inference for this new model as well:

```{r mumin2}
mm2<-dredge(mod2, rank = BIC)
subset(mm2, delta <5)
get.models(mm2, subset = delta < 2)
imp.mm2<-importance(mm2)
barplot(t(imp.mm2), main="Predictors", col="black", xlab="Variable", ylab="Relative support")
```

Pretty much the same than above.

### A Bayesian approach

As we have a relatively small (N = 34) sample size, we'll try now a Bayesian approach (based on Dimas' code) to test the same but under a Bayesian framework based on Monte Carlo Markov Chains

```{r mcmc1}
mod3<-MCMCglmm(abund~people+boats+pets+algae, random = ~ site, data=data, verbose = FALSE)
summary(mod3)
```

OK, it seems that there is no effect at all, as both approaches showed consistent results.
